# Prompt Engineering Improvements for Better Code Indentation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The original AI agent system was generating Python code with inconsistent indentation, which caused syntax errors and made the code difficult to read and execute.

## ✨ Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**
- **Explicit indentation instructions**: Added clear requirements for 4-space indentation
- **PEP 8 compliance**: Enforced strict style guidelines
- **Code formatting rules**: Detailed rules for proper Python formatting
- **Example demonstration**: Included a properly formatted code example in the prompt

### 2. **Improved Code Generation Requirements**
```
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use 4 spaces for indentation (NOT tabs)
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
3. Include proper error handling with try/except blocks
4. Add comprehensive type hints for all functions
5. Include detailed docstrings for all functions and classes
6. Make the code complete and runnable
7. Use proper Python naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables)
```

### 3. **Code Formatting Rules**
```
CODE FORMATTING RULES:
- Indent with exactly 4 spaces per level
- No tabs allowed
- Proper spacing around operators
- Maximum line length of 79 characters
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Import statements at the top
```

### 4. **Example Code in Prompt**
The prompt now includes a properly formatted example that demonstrates:
- Correct 4-space indentation
- Proper docstring formatting
- Type hints
- Error handling
- PEP 8 compliance

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### CoderAgent Enhancements
1. **Enhanced prompt template**: More detailed and specific instructions
2. **Code extraction improvements**: Better handling of generated code
3. **Fallback code**: Properly indented fallback code when generation fails
4. **Syntax validation**: Basic Python syntax checking

### Code Processing Pipeline
1. **Prompt generation**: Enhanced with explicit formatting requirements
2. **Code extraction**: Improved pattern matching for code blocks
3. **Indentation fixing**: Simple but effective indentation correction
4. **Syntax validation**: Ensures generated code is valid Python

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Original Prompts)
```
You are an expert Python developer.

Task: {message.content}
Context: {context}

Requirements:
1. Write clean, well-documented Python code
2. Include proper error handling
3. Add type hints where appropriate
4. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
5. Include docstrings for functions and classes
6. Make sure the code is complete and runnable

Generate only the Python code, no explanations or markdown formatting.
```

### After (Enhanced Prompts)
```
You are an expert Python developer. Generate clean, properly indented Python code.

TASK: {message.content}
CONTEXT: {context}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use 4 spaces for indentation (NOT tabs)
2. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
3. Include proper error handling with try/except blocks
4. Add comprehensive type hints for all functions
5. Include detailed docstrings for all functions and classes
6. Make the code complete and runnable
7. Use proper Python naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables)

CODE FORMATTING RULES:
- Indent with exactly 4 spaces per level
- No tabs allowed
- Proper spacing around operators
- Maximum line length of 79 characters
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Import statements at the top

EXAMPLE OF PROPER FORMATTING:
def calculate_factorial(n: int) -> int:
    \"\"\"
    Calculate the factorial of a number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate factorial for
        
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of n
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative
    \"\"\"
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    
    return result

Generate ONLY the Python code with proper indentation. Do not include explanations, markdown formatting, or any text outside the code block.
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts Created
1. **`test_prompt_improvements.py`**: Tests the improved prompts via API
2. **`test_improved_prompts.py`**: Direct model testing with enhanced prompts

### Test Cases
1. **Simple function generation**: Tests basic indentation
2. **Class with methods**: Tests complex indentation patterns
3. **Error handling**: Tests try/except block formatting
4. **Type hints**: Tests proper type annotation formatting

## 🎉 Expected Results

### Improved Code Quality
- **Consistent indentation**: All code uses 4-space indentation
- **PEP 8 compliance**: Proper spacing and formatting
